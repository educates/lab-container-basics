title: Workshop Overview
---

Containers are a lightweight form of OS-level virtualisation. They enable a set of application processes to be run in their own isolated environment, without the need to run a full operating system.

In this workshop you will learn the basics of how to build container images and run them. We will be using the `docker` tool.

Note that in this workshop environment when using `docker` it will be using your host `docker` runtime environment and not an isolated environment. If you are already running other applications using `docker`, pay attention to what the commands in this workshop are doing and if anything might conflict with what you already have running, you may want to skip this workshop.
